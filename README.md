# Supermarket Mapping

The project is about mapping sales from the nearby supermarkets.


--- Menu ---
The menu screen features two buttons: Register and Login.

The Register button leads to the register screen, where you can insert your name, emsail and password.

The Login screen uses the data registered in the previous screen to enter the app and use more of its functionalities.

--- Login ---
Overall, the Login screen features fields to write your name or email, password or supermarket name if the respective button on the bottom of the screen is selected as such.

--- Register ---
The Register and Login screen look the same but with different functionalities. Registering a person or a supermarket saves the data on the app's databases, allowing for future uses.

--- Main Screen ---
The Main Screen features a search bar where ou can search for sales and a table that shows the sales that you searched for. It also has two buttons on the bottom: Remove Sale and Add Sale.

--- Add Sale ---
This screen shows three fields where you can add new information. Here you can add the supermarket name,  the product name and the price.

--- Remove Sale ---
I is also very similar to the Add Sale screen. It has two fields where you can insert the product name and the location.
